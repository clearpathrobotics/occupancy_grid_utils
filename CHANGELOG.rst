0.0.10 (2016-12-15)
-------------------
* Clear tf_points\_ in CreatePoints in ScanEndPoints
* compile with c++11

* Merge pull request `#13 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/occupancy_grid_utils/issues/13>`_ from clearpathrobotics/simulate_scan_max_range
  Fix Max Range of Simulated Scan
* Raytrace to range_max + resolution instead of range_max + 1
* Fix Max Range of Simulated Scan
  Set the value for open space and unkown to max_range instead of max_range + 1
* Merge pull request `#12 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/occupancy_grid_utils/issues/12>`_ from clearpathrobotics/minor_fix_unused_var

------------------
* Merge pull request `#11 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/occupancy_grid_utils/issues/11>`_ from clearpathrobotics/CORE-3712_handle_raytrace_out_of_bounds
  Handle raytrace out of bounds
* :lipstick:
* Rename project_target_onto_grid param in cpp
  Make the name in the cpp consistent with the name in the header.
* Project target onto grid
  fixes CORE-3712
  This projects the target point onto the grid before ray tracing, so
  it'll never fail to produce a scan, even if the robot is outside the
  map.
* Change maintainer
* Merge pull request `#9 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/occupancy_grid_utils/issues/9>`_ from hrnr/build-fix
  do not export python library
* do not export python library
  it is outdated (eg. generates messages) and gets linked to c++ code which then have dependency on python
